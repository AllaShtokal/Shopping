Shopping.

There is a set of products that you need to buy.
There is a home appliance store and a grocery store, each with its own range of products containing the name and price. 
It is believed that in different stores can not be the same product.

You need to write a Wife class that will pass the list of necessary goods to the Husband class, receive from it and display:

1. a list of all goods of all stores;
2. a list of goods from the required set that are on sale;
3. the total cost of the proposed purchase

For example: for the list of necessary products - Sony, Bread, Lenovo, Onion - , the program should display:

Total list:
Sony - 100
Samsung - 80
Sharp - 70
Apple - 300
Aser - 40
Bread - 110
Sausage - 80
Butter - 70 
Milk - 300
Potato - 40

Bought:
Sony - 100
Bread - 110

Total price = 210

Keep in mind that the Wife class can also think about the need for items from other stores (such as jewelry), and this class does not want to know where the Husband class is going to purchase the necessary items. 

Different types of stores can implement their behavior in different ways.
